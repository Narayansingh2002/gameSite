# gameSite
A web home page for comparing games, this was too mainly test my CSS skills and responsive design.

Moreover, from this project i learnt alot on how and when to use flexbox and to become more confident with my CSS skills. On top of that, my design skills improved after this project, in terms of the placement of text and images, as well as getting comfortable with colour palletes, in terms of creating a brand for the website. I will be expanding this project to further enhance the functionality and interactivity of the site.
